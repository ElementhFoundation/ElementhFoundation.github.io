                        Jack, the owner of a small shoe store, heard about the Elementh blockchain and the resources it
                        offered to small business owners. Although he had never sold anything on the Internet before,
                        Jack decided that it was time to try selling his shoes via the Elementh blockchain, using the
                        special application for vendors. Setting up an online store turned out to be very simple and
                        took a couple of minutes. Having connected his companyâ€™s accounting program to the application,
                        Jack was able to see his entire inventory at a glance and bind it to the single product
                        classification with fine merchandise cards and complete data on the product features.
                        Information on Jack's goods immediately became available to all members of the Elementh network.
                        Steve saw the store with the boots he needed, immediately made an order, and Jack received a
                        notification that Steve wanted to buy his shoes. Customer's money was immediately transferred to
                        a smart contract, which means that the order was real. Having arranged the delivery of the goods
                        to Steve, Jack proceeded to his everyday work in the store. As soon as the goods were delivered,
                        the money was transferred to Jack's account, which means that he didn't have to wait for a long
                        time and could immediately invest the profit in a new product.

                    <p data-i18n="casesT2" class="body">
                        One day Jack decided to expand the product range and to sell branded bags, along with footwear.
                        Without hesitation, he opened the b2b application to find suppliers and manufacturers working in
                        the Elementh blockchain, and found bag manufacturer LOUIS VUITTON. He placed an order,
                        transferring crypto currency to a smart contract. Having received information on Jack's order,
                        the supplier formed a dispatch immediately and transferred data on serial numbers to the smart
                        contract. Now that the transaction is underway, everyone will be able to verify that Jack has
                        authentic LOUIS VUITTON bags in his store and not fake ones. This is because in the Elementh
                        network each manufacturer can track the movement of goods and if several owners of the same
                        serial number for one product appear, it means counterfeit, and its origin is very easy to track
                        and take necessary measures to notify customers about its existence.

                        Steve has long been using applications to find the lowest price for the product he needs. Today
                        he decided that it was time to order new shoes and just in a few minutes he found the couple he
                        needed in Jack's store and placed an order, sending money to a smart contract. Steve has not
                        been afraid to make purchases online and send money to an unknown sellers for a long time. If
                        Steve does not receive the goods, he will simply indicate it in a smart contract and the money
                        will return to him at once. This time his order was processed almost instantly and the courier
                        arrived an hour later. Making sure that the shoes are of the right quality, Steve completed the
                        smart contract and the money went to Jack while Steve became the owner of a new pair of shoes.
                        He can easily sell this pair of shoes in the secondary market as soon as he gets bored with them
                        because Elementh network knows that he has authentic items not counterfeit ones. Just in two
                        clicks he will be able to put them up for sale.
