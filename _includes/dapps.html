                        Based on Elementh's blockchain any marketplace will be able to allow sellers to use existing merchandise cards
                        without creating new ones. Data on the ownership of the product will allow you to get rid of counterfeit products sold
                        through the marketplace. Unified merchandise cards will allow you to easily find the lowest price for any products.
                        At the same time, it becomes possible to pay using any crypto currency.
