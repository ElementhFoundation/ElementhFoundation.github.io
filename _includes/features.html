                    <p data-i18n="featureT1" class="body">
                        Along with the system of tokens, Elementh has a system of goods, which can also be used in a
                        large number of applications,
                        such as tracking the movement of a particular item from its creation to the current owner,
                        tracking original goods
                        and detecting counterfeit goods. Unlike the system of tokens, the system of goods also provides
                        for the ability
                        to "issue" a particular product at a particular address, indicating all possible item's data
                        (such as name, manufacturer,
                        bar code, etc.). And if identical goods are already present in the blockchain, the issuer will
                        receive a message about it,
                        and he will have the opportunity to indicate how many items of goods he wants to "issue". If an
                        item has a serial number,
                        it is possible to specify it when the transfer operation is being performed. To provide
                        protection against data forging,
                        only the hash of the serial number is fixed in the system, therefore only the person who knows
                        the initial number has the ability
                        to make a valid transaction. In the absence of a serial number at the moment of "issuing" goods,
                        the system generates it randomly
                        and the holder is able to use it to identify a particular item of goods by printing out the QR
                        code on the package,
                        writing it in an RFID tag or in any other convenient way.

                    <p data-i18n="featureT2" class="body">
                        One of the key features of Elementh is the availability of a unified nomenclature. To ensure
                        that the merchandise cards are as complete and accurate as possible, and to reduce the
                        likelihood of creating duplicate cards, the cost of creating and using a card will be different.
                        To create a merchandise card a participant will have to pay, for example, 1 EEE (the price will
                        be set by voting of delegates). At the moment when the owner adds an item to the system, he is
                        offered to use an existing card or create a new one. The use of an existing card costs 100 times
                        less than the creation of a new one (for example, 0,01 EEE). The cardholder receives a reward
                        for each owner of goods that uses his card, as well as for making a transaction using this card.
                        Any participant in the system can supplement information in existing cards, and the cardholder
                        can accept or reject the proposed changes.

                        Goods in the system exist in a single copy and if an item with the same serial number is added
                        to the system, any dApp can notify the buyer that the origin of the goods is unknown. If the
                        chain of ownership comes from the manufacturer, the confirmation of authenticity of the goods
                        will be throughout the entire network.
